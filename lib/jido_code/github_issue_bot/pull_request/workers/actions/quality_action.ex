defmodule JidoCode.GithubIssueBot.PullRequest.Workers.Actions.QualityAction do
  @moduledoc """
  Validates the quality of the code fix.

  Runs tests, linting, and type checking on the patched code.

  ## Input

  - run_id: The parent run identifier
  - issue: Map with :title, :body, :repo, :number, etc.
  - triage: Triage results with :classification
  - research: Research findings from the research phase

  ## Output

  Emits quality.result to parent with:
  - tests_passed: Boolean indicating if tests passed
  - lint_passed: Boolean indicating if linting passed
  - typecheck_passed: Boolean indicating if type checking passed
  - failures: List of failure details (empty if all passed)

  ## Current Behavior (Stub)

  Returns mock quality results (usually passing).
  Planned: integrate with actual CI commands (`mix test`, `mix credo`, `mix dialyzer`).
