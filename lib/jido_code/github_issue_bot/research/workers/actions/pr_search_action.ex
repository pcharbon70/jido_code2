defmodule JidoCode.GithubIssueBot.Research.Workers.Actions.PRSearchAction do
  @moduledoc """
  Searches for related PRs and issues.

  Looks for PRs/issues that might be related to the current issue.

  ## Input

  - run_id: The parent run identifier
  - issue: Map with :title, :body, :repo, :number, etc.
  - triage: Triage results with :classification

  ## Output

  Emits pr_search.result to parent with:
  - related_prs: List of potentially related PRs
  - related_issues: List of potentially related issues
  - potential_duplicates: Issues that might be duplicates
  - potential_fixes: Open PRs that might fix this issue
  - summary: Human-readable summary

  ## Current Behavior (Stub)

  Returns mock search results.
  Planned: Use GitHub Search API to find actual related PRs/issues.
