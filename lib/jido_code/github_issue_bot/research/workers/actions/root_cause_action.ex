defmodule JidoCode.GithubIssueBot.Research.Workers.Actions.RootCauseAction do
  @moduledoc """
  Hypothesizes the root cause of an issue.

  Analyzes issue content and triage results to generate a hypothesis.

  ## Input

  - run_id: The parent run identifier
  - issue: Map with :title, :body, :repo, etc.
  - triage: Triage results with :classification

  ## Output

  Emits root_cause.result to parent with:
  - hypothesis: Primary root cause hypothesis
  - confidence: :high, :medium, :low
  - evidence: List of supporting evidence from issue
  - suggested_fix_area: Where to look for the fix
  - summary: Human-readable summary

  ## Current Behavior (Stub)

  Uses simple heuristics based on keywords.
  TODO: Use LLM (via jido_ai ReAct agent) for sophisticated analysis.
