defmodule AgentJido.GithubIssueBot.Research.ResearchCoordinator do
  @moduledoc """
  Research coordinator that fans out to specialized worker agents.

  Spawns 4 parallel workers to research an issue:
  - CodeSearchAgent: Find relevant code in the repository
  - ReproductionAgent: Analyze reproduction steps from issue
  - RootCauseAgent: Hypothesize root cause based on findings
  - PRSearchAgent: Find related PRs and issues

  Aggregates results into a research_report artifact and emits to parent.
