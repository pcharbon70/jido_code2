  - issue: Map with :title, :body, :repo, :number, etc.
  - triage: Triage results with :classification

  ## Output

  Emits pr_search.result to parent with:
  - related_prs: List of potentially related PRs
  - related_issues: List of potentially related issues
  - potential_duplicates: Issues that might be duplicates
  - potential_fixes: Open PRs that might fix this issue
  - summary: Human-readable summary

  ## Current Behavior (Stub)

  Returns mock search results.
