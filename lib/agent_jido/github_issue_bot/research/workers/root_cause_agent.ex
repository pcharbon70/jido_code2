defmodule AgentJido.GithubIssueBot.Research.Workers.RootCauseAgent do
  @moduledoc """
  Worker agent that hypothesizes the root cause of an issue.

  Analyzes:
  - Issue classification from triage
  - Error messages and stack traces
  - Related code findings (from CodeSearchAgent)
  - Reproduction steps

  ## Future Implementation

  Will use LLM (via jido_ai) to hypothesize root causes:
  - Could become a ReAct agent that iteratively refines hypothesis
  - Would consume results from other workers for context

  ## Current Behavior (Stub)

  Returns a simple hypothesis based on issue classification.
