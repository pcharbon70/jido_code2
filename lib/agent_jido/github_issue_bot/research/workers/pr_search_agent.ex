defmodule AgentJido.GithubIssueBot.Research.Workers.PRSearchAgent do
  @moduledoc """
  Worker agent that searches for related PRs and issues.

  Searches for:
  - Open PRs that might already fix this issue
  - Closed PRs that might have caused a regression
  - Duplicate issues (open or closed)
  - Related issues with useful context

  ## Future Implementation

  Will use GitHub Search API to find related PRs/issues:
  - Search by keywords from issue title/body
  - Search by file paths from code search results
  - Check for linked issues/PRs

  ## Current Behavior (Stub)

  Returns mock search results.
