defmodule AgentJido.GithubIssueBot.PullRequest.Workers.PatchAgent do
  @moduledoc """
  Worker agent that implements the code fix for an issue.

  Given issue details and research findings, creates:
  - A new git branch
  - Code changes to fix the issue
  - Commits with descriptive messages

  ## Future Implementation

  Will use an AI code generation model to:
  1. Analyze the research findings
  2. Generate appropriate code changes
  3. Create commits via GitHub API or local git

  Could become a ReAct agent that iteratively refines the fix.

  ## Current Behavior (Stub)

  Returns mock patch data based on issue details.
