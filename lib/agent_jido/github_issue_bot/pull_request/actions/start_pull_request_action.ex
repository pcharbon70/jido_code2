defmodule AgentJido.GithubIssueBot.PullRequest.Actions.StartPullRequestAction do
  @moduledoc """
  Handles "pull_request.request" signal.

  Initiates the sequential fix flow by spawning PatchAgent first.
  The flow continues: Patch → Quality → (retry?) → PR Submit

  ## Flow

  1. Spawns PatchAgent to create the fix
  2. PatchResultAction will spawn QualityAgent
  3. QualityResultAction will either:
     - Spawn PRSubmitAgent (if quality passes)
     - Spawn PatchAgent again (if quality fails, attempts < max)
     - Emit failure (if quality fails, attempts >= max)
