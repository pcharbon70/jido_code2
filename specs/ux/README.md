# UX Spec Pack

This subfolder defines user-centered planning artifacts for JidoCode:

1. target user personas
2. end-to-end user journeys
3. route-level experience flows
4. high-level story inventory

Detailed implementation-grade stories live in `../stories/`.

These UX docs are aligned with:

- `../02_requirements_and_scope.md`
- `../10_web_ui_and_routes.md`
- `../11_onboarding_flow.md`
- `../30_workflow_system_overview.md`
- `../31_builtin_workflows.md`
- `../50_github_integration.md`
- `../60_security_and_auth.md`
- `../stories/README.md`

## Documents

- `01_user_personas.md`
- `02_user_journey.md`
- `03_routes_and_experience_flows.md`
- `04_user_stories.md`
- `../stories/README.md`

## Scope Notes

- MVP is the default scope unless a section is explicitly marked Phase 2+.
- Cloud VM deployment is primary; local mode remains supported for development/fallback.
- Naming is canonical: `JidoCode`.
- Persona priority: OSS maintainer primary, solo developer secondary.
- Product mode is single-user only (no multi-tenant support).
